                    Signing in to Squadder is meant to be quick and easy. It is also important that the user feels safe
                    and
                    secure.
                    When you sign up with an external account to our service, we will only gather the nessacary
                    information
                    about you, and you will never receive any kind of promotion or advertising to your email account.
                    In fact, you will never recieve any email from Squadder at all.

                    Right now, your only way of signing up to Squadder is by your Google account. Squadder is in
                    it's
                    early
                    stages and creating multiple options for registration is not prioritized right now.
                    When you click the Google button to sign up you will be rederected to a pop up window. This pop
                    up
                    window is provided by Google itself and is also secured by Google. The only data returned to us
                    after
                    signing in is already public information. That means we will not gather any private information
                    such
                    as
                    your password.

                <div class="documentText">
                    The first time you registrer with out service you will be asked to create your own personal
                    username. This is the username that other people will have to use to connect with you on our
                    platform.
                    That means your username has to be unique. It also means that you cannot change your username
                    once
                    it is created. Racist or inappropriate usernames will not be tolerated, and your user profiles
                    will
                    be removed without warning, as well as all your data on our database.

                <div class="documentText">
                    In all Squads you will be presented with your real name. That means your messages will wear the name
                    provided by the service you used to sign up with Squadder.
                    Unlike your username, this name can be changed at any time by going to settings in the user page.
                    Although this name will be displayed on your messages, it doesn't mean it makes you anonymous. By
                    hovering over your name, people can still see your profile including your unique username.
                    As with the username, racist or inappropriate names will result in deletion of your profile, as well
                    as all your data on our database.
